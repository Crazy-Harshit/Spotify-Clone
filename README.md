## üöÄ About The Project

This project is a visual replica of the Spotify web application's user interface. It was built from scratch to practice and showcase proficiency in modern CSS techniques like Flexbox for layout management, custom styling for components like sliders, and creating a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

The clone includes the main components of the Spotify UI: the sidebar for navigation, the main content area for music discovery, and the persistent music player at the bottom.

## ‚ú® Features

  - **Navigation Sidebar:** A fixed sidebar containing links for Home, Search, and Your Library.
  - **Dynamic Library Section:** Includes UI elements for creating playlists and browsing podcasts.
  - **Main Content Area:**
      - A sticky top navigation bar with user controls.
      - Card-based layout to display playlists, albums, and songs.
      - Sections for "Recently Played," "Trending," and "Featured Charts."
  - **Music Player Bar:**
      - A fixed player at the bottom of the page that displays the current song's album art, title, and artist.
      - Standard player controls (play, pause, next, previous, etc.).
      - A custom-styled progress bar and volume controls.
  - **Responsive Design:** The layout is responsive and adapts to smaller screen sizes. For example, some navigation elements are hidden on screens narrower than 1000px to maintain a clean interface.
  - **Hover Effects:** Interactive hover effects on buttons, links, and player controls to improve user experience.
